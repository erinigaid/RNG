# RNG Project
## Computer Systems Modeling &amp; Analysis Course Project

Write a Java program to implement the six types of the random number generators:

1.Linear Congruentail generator (LCG)

2.Multiplicative Congruentail generator (MCG)

3.Inversive Congruentail generator (ICG)

4.Multiple recursive generator (MRG)

5.Lagged Fibonacci generator (LFG)

6.Mid-Square method (MSM)

* the code must generate at least 4 random numbers
